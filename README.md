# Railway-Reservation-System
A DBMS project which is made using Nodejs and Express , MongoDB and Mongoose and Ejs as templating engine . A user will book trains using this 
application, and it would include all the usual form fields which a Railway Reservation System includes and all the functionalities which
a System inculdes, difference is I will be using AngularJS on the client Side to Render Data from server using $HTTP services.
On a whole I am doing it to learn how things work when working with MEAN stack.
This is My Subject Project which I am making for my Database Management Subject using NOSQL language.
